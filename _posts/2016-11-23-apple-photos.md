Today I learned that Apple Photos does not display your photos. Instead, it displays a compressed version thereof. I assume this is done to save space and time, but it doesn't make sense for an application meant to display your photos. 

For example, the next photo is a screen shot of a photo (cropped) that I took with my Sony a5000. The first copy is from Photos, the second on Preview:

![Apple Photos at 100%](../res/photos100.png)
_Apple Photos at 100%_

![Preview at 100%](../res/preview100.png)
_Preview at 100%_

Now, zooming in some:

![Apple Photos zoomed in](../res/photosZoom.png)
_Apple Photos zoomed in_

![Preview zoomed in](../res/previewZoom.png)
_Preview zoomed in_

As you can see from this completely unscientific result, using Apple Photos results in a lot of pixelization and looks worse even at 100%. I would not reccomend using Apple Photos for viewing photos.
