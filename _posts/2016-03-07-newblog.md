##Welcome!

Check out my new blog! Since I will be working more on actual development projects now, I decided to make a blog to document my experiences with creating things using technology. This will help me improve at explaining technical things in a coherent, understandable way. Maybe one day someone will find something useful here as well.

Enjoy!
