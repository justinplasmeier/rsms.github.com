##Mass Music Sync

Beginning as a hackathon project, I have decided to continue working on a music sync program to use with my FiiO X1. The program is for OSX only as of now but a Linux version should happen soon after version 0.1 is released. 

Version 0.1 features include validation against data from Last.fm/other internet services to ensure your music is properly tagged. Additionally, support for binning artists into groups to minize scrolling will be implemented as soon as the device registration and sync functionalities are implemented.

I'm hoping to have 0.1 out within the next few weeks. Stay tuned!
