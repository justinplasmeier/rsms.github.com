##Mathematics BA:

Classes Remaining:
- 3 half-semester PE classes
- SAGES University Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Dept. Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Capstone (3 credits)
- Global and Cultural Diversity Elective (3 credits)
- Fundamentals of Real Analysis II (3 credits)
- Complex Analysis (3 credits)
- 1 Math Elective (Model Theory)

That's 21 total credits. The best option would be split up between one 12 and one 9 (+3) credit semester. 

##Math BA, Computer Science BA:

Everything above, plus:
- Algorithms (3 credits)
- Architecture (3 credits)
- Programming Language Concepts* (3  credits)
- 1 CS Elective (3 credits)
*might not be required/count as the elective. Who knows?

This would add 12 credits for a total of 33 credits. This would be done as one 15 credit semester and one 18 credit semester. 

##Mathematics BS:

Everything from the first post, plus:
- Modern Physics (3 credits, can possibly take placement exam)
- Math Technical Elective (3 credits)
- 1 extra math class (1 credit)
For a total of 7 additional credits and 28 credits total. This would be done in two 14 credit semesters.

##Computer Science BA:

Everything from the first post, plus:
- Architecture (3)
- Programming Language Concepts (3)
- 1 CS Tech Elective (3)
Plus 9, for 30 credits total. 

Results:

Degree	Semester 1	Semester 2
Math BA	12	9
Math BS

14	14
Comp Sci BA	15	15
Math BA, Comp Sci BA	18	
15

I think 18/15 would be a little bit too much to handle.
