##I'm withdrawing from Case for this semester

I realized just before Spring Break this semester that continuing to stay in school at Case Western would be poisonous to my health, and that it would be much more beneficial to withdraw from the University and take some time to work on my projects. Having found motivation for the first time since Elementary School, I need to see the results of my motivated work before I can properly handle school. Additionally, when I return to school in the Fall, I do not plan on continuing to study Computer Science at Case Western. I will either finish my Mathematics degree or transfer to another school and finish my Computer Science studies there. 

##I'm going to do this instead

First, I am going to focus on my health, specifically reestablishing healthy sleep, exercise, and eating habits. I'm going to start working 30-40 hours per week doing web development consulting. After that, I’m going to work on my own side projects ranging from my blog and resume to projects which implement what I had been learning in my classes. This will give me enough time to see the fruits of my labor ripen. 

##What’s next?

I do plan on returning to school in the Fall. I ran the numbers and I can still graduate on time even without any credit from this semester. However, I will likely only be able to get a degree in Math and not Computer Science. Since my aspirations are geared more towards data science, I think that my Math degree combined with software engineering experience will serve me well enough. If I transfer elsewhere, I would complete a degree in Computer Science. That’s something I need to do more research about though. 


#Academic Feasibility
Before actually withdrawing, I wanted to make sure I could still graduate in two remaining semesters at Case Western. I ran the numbers and came up with these results:

###Mathematics BA:
Classes Remaining:

- 3 half-semester PE classes
- SAGES University Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Dept. Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Capstone (3 credits)
- Global and Cultural Diversity Elective (3 credits)
- Fundamentals of Real Analysis II (3 credits)
- Complex Analysis (3 credits)
- 1 Math Elective (Model Theory)

That's 21 total credits. The best option would be split up between one 12 and one 9 (+3 to stay full time) credit semester. 

###Math BA, Computer Science BA:

Everything above, plus:

- Algorithms (3 credits)
- Architecture (3 credits)
- Programming Language Concepts* (3  credits)

**might not be required but would count as an elective. Who knows?*

This would add 9 credits for a total of 30 credits. This would be done as one 15 credit semester and one 15 credit semester. 

###Mathematics BS:

Everything from the first post, plus:

- Modern Physics (3 credits, can take placement exam)
- 4 Math Technical Electives (12 credits)

For a total of 15 additional credits and 36 credits total. This would be done in two 18 credit semesters, or one 18 and one 15 credit semesters if I can test out of Modern Physics. 

###Computer Science BA:

Everything from the first post, minus:

- Real Analysis II (3)
- Complex Analysis (3)
- Math Technical Elective (3)

and plus:

- Algorithms (3)
- Architecture (3)
- Programming Language Concepts (3)

For a net of 0 additional credits and 21 credits total. This would be done in two 12 credit semesters.  

##Results:

###Math BA
**Semester 1 (12 credits):**

- 2 half-semester PE classes (0 credits)
- SAGES University Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Dept. Seminar (3 credits)
- Complex Analysis (3 credits)
- Open Elective (3 credits)

**Semester 2 (12 credits):**

- 1 half-semester PE class (0 credits)
- SAGES Capstone (3 credits)
- Global and Cultural Diversity Elective (3 credits)
- Fundamentals of Real Analysis II (3 credits)
- 1 Math Elective (Model Theory) (3 credits)

###Math BA, CS BA
**Semester 1 (15 credits):**

- 2 half-semester PE classes (0 credits)
- SAGES University Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Dept. Seminar (3 credits)
- Complex Analysis (3 credits)
- Algorithms (3 credits)
- Architecture (3 credits)

**Semester 2 (15 credits):**

- 1 half-semester PE class (0 credits)
- SAGES Capstone (3 credits)
- Global and Cultural Diversity Elective (3 credits)
- Fundamentals of Real Analysis II (3 credits)
- 1 Math Elective (Model Theory) (3 credits)
- Programming Language Concepts* (3  credits)

###Math BS
**Semester 1 (21/18 credits):**

- 2 half-semester PE classes (0 credits)
- SAGES University Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Dept. Seminar (3 credits)
- Complex Analysis (3 credits)
- Open Elective (3 credits)
- Modern Physics (3 credits, can take placement exam)
- 2 Math Technical Elective (6 credits)

**Semester 2 (18 credits):**

- 1 half-semester PE class (0 credits)
- SAGES Capstone (3 credits)
- Global and Cultural Diversity Elective (3 credits)
- Fundamentals of Real Analysis II (3 credits)
- 1 Math Elective (Model Theory) (3 credits)
- 2 Math Technical Electives (6 credits)

###CS BA
**Semester 1 (12 credits):**

- 2 half-semester PE classes (0 credits)
- SAGES University Seminar (3 credits)
- SAGES Dept. Seminar (3 credits)
- Algorithms (3 credits)
- Architecture (3 credits)

**Semester 2 (12 credits):**

- 1 half-semester PE class (0 credits)
- SAGES Capstone (3 credits)
- Global and Cultural Diversity Elective (3 credits)
- Programming Language Concepts* (3  credits)
- Open Elective (3 credits)

##Conclusion

**Math BA:** 12/12

**Math BA, CS BA:** 15/15

**Math BS:** (21/18)/18

**CS BA:** 12/12

Based on this, completing a Math BA and a CS BA would be the most reasonable course of action. The other plans are either too light or too heavy, and each only come with one major anyway.
