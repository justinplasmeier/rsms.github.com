Hi! My name is Justin Plasmeier. I'm a Math and Computer Science student at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/) and a software engineer currently working for [Concur](https://www.concur.com/). I love learning about and using new technologies, so I made this blog to document my learning experiences.
