<p>At Answers, I developed novel web application features for an existing project in the <strong>ASP.NET framework using C#, Javascript, HTML, and CSS</strong> in a <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> environment. For my other project, I built a <strong>Windows Forms application</strong> from scratch in <strong>C#</strong> to interface with a <strong>SQL database</strong> and conditionally restrict data using logical expressions based on the SQL schema. Additionally, I repaired a <strong>C#</strong> application to safely retry a data fetch operation and wrote a comprehensive stored procedure in <strong>T-SQL</strong> to automate a tedious data feed import.</p>
