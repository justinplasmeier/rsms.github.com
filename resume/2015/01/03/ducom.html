<p>As part of Drexelâ€™s HSSRI Program, I designed, wrote, and implemented an original <strong>data analysis</strong> algorithm (in <strong>Java</strong>) to find recurring motor primitive symbol patterns from EMG data. I conducted research using proprietary braided neural electrodes. At the end of the program, I presented my work at the Discovery Day 2012 research symposium.</p>
